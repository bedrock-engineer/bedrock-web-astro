## Overview

> **Definition of Bedrock**
>
> In an abstract sense, the bedrock refers to the main principles something is based on. [1]
>
> In the real world, the bedrock is the hard area of rock in the ground that holds up the loose soil above. [1]
>
> In many civil engineering projects, the identification of the bedrock through digging, drilling or geophysical methods is an important task, which greatly influences (geotechnical) design. [2]

Ground Investigation (GI) data is often trapped in legacy formats that limit analysis and visualization possibilities.
`bedrock-ge` lets you transform this data from specialized geotechnical formats and common tabular formats (Excel, CSV) into modern, standardized geospatial data.

This standardization lets you bridge the gap between raw geotechnical data, the modern Python (geo)scientific ecosystem and modern geospatial tools.
This gives geotechnical engineers greater flexibility in visualization, modeling, and integration across different software environments while avoiding vendor lock-in.
For example, this enables connecting your GI data with GIS as well as BIM environments through [platforms like Speckle](#-put-your-gi-data-into-speckle).

The purpose of Bedrock is NOT to become THE standard for geotechnical data, because [we don't need 15 instead of 14 competing standards](https://xkcd.com/927/).

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## API Reference Generation

The API reference documentation in `src/content/docs/reference/` is auto-generated from the bedrock-ge Python package using pydoc-markdown.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure Python environment is set up:
   ```bash
   uv init --python 3.9  # Only needed once
   uv add pydoc-markdown bedrock-ge  # Install dependencies
   ```

### Generating API Documentation

To regenerate the API reference documentation:

```bash
uv run pydoc-markdown
uv run python update_frontmatter.py
```

These commands:

1. **Generate docs**: Reads the configuration from `pydoc-markdown.yml`, extracts docstrings from bedrock-ge, and creates markdown files in `src/content/docs/reference/`
2. **Update frontmatter**: Adds `prev: false` and `next: false` to all generated files for better Starlight navigation

**Note**: You may see warnings about deprecated `pkg_resources` and unknown configuration options - these are harmless and the generation will complete successfully.

### Configuration

The generation is controlled by `pydoc-markdown.yml`:

- **Filters**: Excludes private members (starting with `_`), special members, and common imports
- **Output**: Creates individual markdown files per module
- **Format**: Generates Starlight-compatible frontmatter and structure

The generated files automatically integrate with Starlight's navigation via the `autogenerate: { directory: "reference" }` setting in `astro.config.mjs`.
