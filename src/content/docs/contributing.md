Contributing isnâ€™t just about writing code:

* Use Bedrock and provide feedback
* Share how you use Bedrock
* If you have a project with publicly available GI data, please share that in a discussion, such that we can create a tutorial from it.
* Help each other out, e.g. by replying to questions in the discussions or bedrock-ge issues
* Spread the word about Bedrock!
* Writing and improving documentation and tutorials
* Most pages on the bedrock.engineer website can be edited, so if you see a spelling mistake or have a suggestion on how to explain something better, please fix it by clicking that button.
