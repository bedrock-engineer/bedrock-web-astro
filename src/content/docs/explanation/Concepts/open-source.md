The geotechnical industry traditionally relies on proprietary software and specialized formats, creating vendor lock-in and limiting interoperability.

`bedrock-ge` is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), meaning it gives you full access to the code, and you can customize `bedrock-ge` to integrate with other tools and fit your workflows and project needs.

As the name implies, FOSS is free to use, so you’re not tied to expensive software licenses or locked into a specific software vendor.
<!-- You can give feedback and contribute, such that together we can build the tools we’ve always wanted and needed. -->

## What is Open-source?

Open-source software makes its source code freely available for viewing, modification, and distribution. Key characteristics:

- **Transparency**: Inspect calculations and verify algorithms
- **Vendor independence**: No single company controls access
- **Community-driven**: Collaborative development by global communities
- **Cost-effective**: No licensing fees or forced upgrades
- **Longevity**: Remains available even if developers stop maintaining it
- **Automation-friendly**: Programmatic interfaces enable automated workflows

<!-- ## Why Open-source? -->

<!-- ## The automation problem with proprietary software

Most proprietary engineering software only offers graphical user interfaces (GUIs), creating significant barriers to automation. Engineers are forced to manually "type and click data from program A to program B," making iterative analysis, parametric studies, and integration with other tools extremely difficult.

For example, in structural engineering, this limitation led to the creation of [anaStruct](https://www.ritchievink.com/anastruct/), an open-source Python package that represents models in code rather than through GUI interactions. This enables: 

- **Reproducibility**: Code-based models can be reproduced exactly
- **Version control**: Models saved as code can be tracked and compared
- **Templates**: Reusable model structures across projects
- **Iterative analysis**: Feed results from one calculation into another
- **Automated workflows**: Programmatic generation and analysis of multiple scenarios

The same challenges exist in geotechnical engineering, where proprietary software often locks data and workflows behind GUI-only interfaces. -->

## Industry adoption of open-source

<!-- Data science -->
<!-- Climatology -->

Major companies increasingly recognize the value of open-source software and contribute to the ecosystem.
For example, **Equinor** maintains an [open-source program](https://opensource.equinor.com/) with tools for subsurface modeling, data processing, and reservoir simulation.

<!-- This trend reflects recognition that collaborative development often produces more robust, well-tested software than isolated proprietary solutions. -->
