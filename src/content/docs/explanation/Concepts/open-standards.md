## Open standards

Open standards are publicly available specifications for data formats, protocols, or interfaces. They are:

- **Publicly documented**: Complete specifications freely available
- **Vendor-neutral**: Not controlled by any single company
- **Royalty-free**: Can be implemented without licensing fees
- **Interoperable**: Enable different software systems to work together

Open standars are all around us, you make use of them everyday. Think of USB-C, HDMI, tile sizes, wooden beam size, railway tracks, metric system.

## The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)

[The OGC](https://www.ogc.org/) develops open standards for geospatial data and services. Some relevant standards are:

- **GeoPackage**: SQLite-based format for storing geospatial data in a single file
- **GeoJSON**: JSON-based format for geographic data structures
- **Simple Feature Access (SFA)**: Defines geometric features (points, lines, polygons) in databases

## Benefits for geotechnical engineering

### Practical advantages

- **No vendor lock-in**: Data remains accessible regardless of software vendor decisions
- **Cost control**: No recurring licensing fees or forced upgrades
- **Tool flexibility**: Use the best software for each task
- **Transparency**: Understand how calculations are performed
- **Customization**: Modify software for specific project requirements
- **Integration**: Seamless data exchange between different tools

### Professional advantages

- **Reproducibility**: Analysis workflows can be shared and verified
- **Peer review**: Methods can be independently validated
- **Community support**: Access to global communities of practice
- **Future-proofing**: Open formats ensure long-term data accessibility

## Traditional vs. open formats

Traditional geotechnical formats (AGS, DIGGS, GEF) are publicly documented but designed primarily for industry-specific data exchange. Open geospatial standards offer broader compatibility:

- **GeoPackage files** work with any GIS software
- **GeoJSON** enables web-based visualization
- **OGC standards** have broad international support
- **Access** to the entire geospatial computing ecosystem

## Getting started

1. **Start small**: Use open-source tools for specific tasks (visualization, format conversion)
2. **Parallel workflows**: Run alongside traditional methods for validation
3. **Export to open formats**: Ensure long-term data accessibility
4. **Join communities**: Learn from global user communities

## Why this matters

Open-source and open standards align with engineering principles of transparency, peer review, and continuous improvement. For geotechnical engineering, they offer a path toward more integrated, flexible workflows in an increasingly data-driven industry.
